# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to assess how the data for ridesharing differs between urban, suburban, and rural cities by using Pandas and Matplotlib to create data visualizations.

## Results:

### Pyber Summary Data Frame

The information below was collected using the following data frame:

  * Total Rides

I calculated that the total rides to be the lowest in rural areas, second lowest in suburban areas, and highest in urban areas.

 * Total Drivers

I calculated that the total drivers followed the same trend as total rides, with the smallest number of drivers in rural areas, second smallest in suburban areas, and highest number of drivers in urban areas.

 * Total Fares

I calculated that the total fare to be the highest in rural areas, second highest in suburban areas, and lowest in urban areas. The cost of rides could have been driven up due to a shortage of drivers.

 * Average Fare Per Ride

The average fare per ride follows the same trend as total fares, which is highest fares in rural areas, second highest fares in suburban areas, and lowest in urban areas.

* Average Fare Per Driver

According to this data frame, drivers in rural areas make the most profit from their passengers, suburban drivers make the second most amount of money, and urban drivers make the least profit. 


### Total Fare by City Type

Using the multi-line chart below, I found that the total fare by city type is consistently highest for rural cities, then suburban cities, and has the lowest fare in urban cities. For all three city types, the fare remains relatively stable and then spikes in late Febuary.

## Summary:
To rectify disparities among city types, I reccomend three action items:

1. Decrease fares in rural areas by implementing an advertising campaign for PyBer that encourage more people to use this service. 
2. Redistribute the income of drivers living in rural areas to supplement the income of drivers in urban areas. 
3. Charge less per mile in rural areas to encourage the use of ride sharing, and reduce costs for potential clients. This would levalize the income made from rural and urban drivers and make ridesharing more affordable in rural and suburban areas.
