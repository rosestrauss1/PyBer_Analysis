# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to assess how the data about ridesharing differs between urban, suburban, and rural cities by using Pandas and Matplotlib to create data visualizations.

## Results:

### Pyber Summary Data Frame

The information below was collected using the following data frame:



  * Total Rides

I calculated that the total rides to be the lowest in rural areas, second lowest in suburban areas, and highest in urban areas.

 * Total Drivers

I calculated that the total drivers followed the same trend as total rides, with the smallest number of drivers in rural areas, second smallest in suburban areas, and highest number of drivers in urban areas.

 * Total Fares

I calculated that the total fare to be the highest in rural areas, second highest in suburban areas, and lowest in urban areas. The cost of rides could have been driven up due to a shortage of drivers.

 * Average Fare Per Ride & Average Fare Per Driver

Both average fare per ride and average fare per driver follow the same trend as total fares, which is highest in rural areas, second highest in suburban areas, and lowest in urban areas.


### Total Fare by City Type

Using the multi-line chart below, we can tell that the total fare by city type is consistently highest for rural cities, then suburban cities, and has the lowest fare in urban cities. For all three city types, the fare remains relatively stable and then spikes in late Febuary. 

## Summary:
To rectify disparities among city types, I reccomend three action items:
1. 
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
